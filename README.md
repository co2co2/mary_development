## Features

Most of our features come from the multiple search filters we have, coupled by google maps integration to find nearby dispensaries.


## Testing

Integration tests rather than TDD.  TDD would have cut down on our two 

week development time, which was needed to put out features ASAP.

Used Factorybot for testing.
